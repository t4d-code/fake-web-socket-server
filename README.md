# Fake Web Socket Server

## Setup

To add the fake web socket server to your application, run the following command in a terminal window within your project's top-level folder (where package.json lives)

```
npm install -D -E fake-web-socket-server
```

This command will install and register the fake web socket server as a development dependency (not poluting your production releases). Also, the version number will be fixed to prevent against future upgrades from breaking your code.
